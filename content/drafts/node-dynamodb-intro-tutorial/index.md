Amazon's DynamoDB is a unique and fairly popular NoSQL database solution, especially for more enterprise/professional
 undertakings. I personally know I'll be using it at my job some time soon, so I figured I'd learn the basics and 
 whip up a quick tutorial to solidify my learning and save future readers some time and mental energy.
 
 ####In this tutorial, you'll learn how to do the following.
 
 0. Setup AWS-SDK in a super basic Node.js project
 1. Create a "Movies" table
 2. Create _Fast & Furious_ movies as items in the table
 3. List all of the movies in the table
 4. Edit a movie's Rotten Tomatoes score
 5. Search movies only with "Fresh" Rotten Tomatoes scores
 6. Delete a movie
 7. _Optional: Be motivated to watch a movie with insane car stunts and egregiously indestructible characters._

##Before getting into the code...
1. Make an AWS account
2. Setup AWS CLI
