### Want more project recs?

I'm always late to find out about cool/amazing/game-changing/time-saving JavaScript-related projects,
so I'm experimenting with ways to uncover potentially helpful tools and resources every week.

So to get more of these project recommendation lists, [join my mailing list](https://www.ryanjyost.com/subscribe) or
 [follow me on Twitter @ryanjyost](https://twitter.com/ryanjyost)

### How the list was built

The projects below were starred by multiple experienced, influential developers, which I compiled from Googling
 "JavaScript developers to follow" and looking at who I currently follow on Twitter. Their
 GitHub usernames are _addyosmani, paulirish, thefoxis, umaar, elijahmanor, jeresig, dshaw, kentcdodds, johnpapa
 , darkwing, sachag, wesbos, getify, markdalgleish, chriscoyier, mdo, ry, yyx990803, Rich-Harris, sdras, emmabostian
 , markerikson, btholt, benlesh_.
 
For each developer, I used GitHub's starring api to fetch their recently starred repos, limited the scope to the past
 6 months, filtered out non JavaScript/TypeScript repos, then counted total stars form the user list for each repo and
  found the projects with multiple stars.
  
Here's a gist with some messy code that does it.
